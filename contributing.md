Great guide for contributing:

1. Fork the project & clone locally.
2. Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch.
3. Branch for each separate piece of work.
4. Do the work, write good commit messages, and read the CONTRIBUTING file if there is one.
5. Push to your origin repository.
6. Create a new PR in GitHub/Bitbucket.
7. Respond to any code review feedback.
